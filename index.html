                I am a 19 years old computer science student at City University of London in my first year and in this
                page<br>
                I will be showing you the different projects I have been working on and I have created. Before City I

                <h4 class="Project-name">Project name: The Random Party Theme</h4>
                
                <p>
                    This is my first project that i have developed in my time in University and this project was
                    made during the first two weeks of bootcamp. This is a Processing project is very simple and
                    shows my understanding in loops, randomness, and sound and here is what it does:
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project is a background party program which gives a mood and theme to a party by playing
                    a song in the background while shapes are changing their size and color randomly and
                    additionaly there is a sphere spining which adds to the party theme. I achieved this by
                    using for loops which allow all the rectangles and circles to be positioned correctly and
                    additionally it allows them to change their size randomnly every second.

                        <h4>Project name: Galaxy Portals I </h4>

                            Galaxy Portals I is an Arcade game that was developed using Java. The main aim of the 
                            game is to make it through the galxy alive and with as many energy balls collected.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When playing through the game you encounter different troubles like figuring out what the best
                             route is to the next portal or figuring out how to avoid the enemies while making your way
