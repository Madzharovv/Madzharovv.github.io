                            I am an 18 years old computer science student at City University of London in my first year and in this page I will be showing you the different projects I have been working on and I have created. Before City I have been doing some web development and also I have been making some little programs using Visual Basic. Aditionally I am very interested in working in front-end  Web Development and I am very passionate about learning new skils and improving my knowledge about the industry.

                            <h4>Project name:  The Random Party Theme</h4>          
                            <p>
                            This is my first project that i have developed in my time in University and this project was made during the first two weeks of bootcamp. This is a Processing project  is very simple and shows my understanding in loops, randomness, and sound and here is what it does:     
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             The project is a background party program which gives a mood and theme to a party by playing a song in the background while shapes are changing their size and color randomly and additionaly there is a sphere spining which adds to the party theme. I achieved this by using for loops which allow all the rectangles and circles to be positioned correctly and additionally it allows them to change their size randomnly every second.
